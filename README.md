# SEBC-projects
Lab projects to implement low-power IC design techniques:
1. Probabilistic techniques for power estimation;
2. FSM assignments and VHDL synthesis;
3. Techniques to reduce power consumption: clock gating, pipelining and parallelizing;
4. Bus encoding techniques to reduce the switching activity;
5. Using Spice simulations for the characterization of standard cells;
6. Power-aware design using UPF (Unified Power Format) language.
